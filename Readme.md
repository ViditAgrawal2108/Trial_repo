## Question 1

## Problem
We have been asked to sample the given table data into two different tables with negative and positive samples for our machine learning model.

## Intuition --> 

- Step 1 -- Order the data into ASC and DESC.
- Step 2 -- Assign row numbers to each row of the new sorted data and then sample them through taking alternatively third row.
- Step 3 -- we will set the limit/or take the top 10000 rows from the data that we get from the above steps.

## Code --> 
``` 

Select Top 10000 image_id , score
From
( Select * , row_number() over( order by score asc/desc ) as row_num
From table )
Where row_num % 3 = 0 ;
